This is project was built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
This is an app to manage a collection of books for a fictional library 
The user can browse the books in the database and edit them. New books can also be aded to the books data base.
Pagination was added for the users ease of use and also a search function.
The user can search for books with key words that will match the the author, title, genre or year.
Pagination of for the search results has also been added as well as active class for the current pagination links.
There is form validation through sequelize so that the form will not submit if any of the fields are empty. 
Also if the year is a number the form will not submit. 
For styles I added a background for the main page as well as a background for an error page. 

This project was challening but also fun to work with. I learned more about error handling and routing as well as
how to use Sequelize.
